The workflow have been tested on Ubuntu Linux 20.04 and 22.04.

Apart from standard bash commands (tested using bash v. 5.1.16), a number of
additional software, including their dependencies, needs to be installed.

Also note that the path to some of theses programs, as well as both hardware-
and data type specific settings needs to be manually set in the main script
before running.

As an alternative to local installation, one may run the workflow using a
[singularity/apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) container. A definition file
for building the container is provided [atpw.def](singularity/atpw.def). See
[README.md](singularity/README.md)

## Software used (and version):

Python (python v3.10). See also note on requirments for TreeShrink below:

    $ sudo apt install python3.10

BMGE (v1.12):

Extract the BMGE.jar from the compressed archives from <http://ftp.pasteur.fr/pub/gensoft/projects/BMGE/>

GNU parallel (v20161222):

    $ sudo apt install parallel

ParGenes (v1.2.0):

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/BenoitMorel/ParGenes.git
    $ cd ParGenes
    $ ./install.sh

RAxML-NG (v1.1.0):

    $ wget https://github.com/amkozlov/raxml-ng/releases/download/1.1.0/raxml-ng_v1.1.0_linux_x86_64.zip
    (and unzip, rename to raxml-ng and copy `raxml-ng` to your path)

TreeShrink (v1.3.9):

**Note**: a python version < 3.9 is needed for simple installation of current
TreeShrink!  If using python3.10, a patch is needed. See example below and
<https://github.com/nylander/Align-and-trees-parallel-workflow/issues/2> for
details and alternatives.

    $ git clone https://github.com/uym2/TreeShrink.git
    $ cd TreeShrink
    $ sed -i '/import collections/a from collections.abc import MutableMapping' dendropy/utility/container.py
    $ sed -i 's/class CaseInsensitiveDict(collections.MutableMapping):/class CaseInsensitiveDict(collections.abc.MutableMapping):/' dendropy/utility/container.py
    $ python setup.py install --user

TrimAl (v1.4.rev22)

    $ git clone https://github.com/inab/trimal.git
    $ cd trimal/source
    $ make
    (and copy `trimal` to your path)

fastagap.pl (v1.0):

    $ git clone https://github.com/nylander/fastagap.git
    (and copy `fastagap.pl` to your path)

mafft (v7.453):

    $ sudo apt install mafft

## Testing

For testing the installation, try:

    $ src/align-and-trees-parallel-workflow.sh -d nt data test

A successful run is summarized in `test/README.md`.  A run log file is written
to `test/ATPW.log` and may contain information useful for trouble-shooting.
