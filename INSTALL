The workflow have been tested on Ubuntu Linux 20.04.

Apart from standard bash commands (tested using bash v. 5.1.16), a number of
additional software, including their dependencies, needs to be installed.

Also note that the path to some of theses programs, as well as both hardware-
and data type specific settings needs to be manually set in the main script
before running.

As an alternative to local installation, one may run the workflow using a
[singularity]() container. A definition file for building the container is
provided [atpw.def](singularity/atpw.def). See
[README.md](singularity/README.md)
